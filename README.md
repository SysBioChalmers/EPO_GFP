Relative scripts and files to manuscript needed to reproduce the results are available at: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/290705446.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/290705446)

Fastq files for transcriptomics analysis: 

## Repository organisation
scripts: The folder contains scripts for differential expression, gene set analysis and correlation analysis.

data: The folder contains raw counts, TPM and inputs for gene set analysis.
Note that ro reproduce all results you will first need to retrieve the larger data files from the associated Zenodo repository prior to re-running the analyses. This is described in further detail by the README in the data directory.

results: The folder contains processed data and results disscussed in the paper.
